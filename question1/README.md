## Question 1
Write a shell script that does the following:
1. Create a directory called "unix".  
2. Copy the "unix" directory to another directory called "unix2".  
3. Create an empty file in "unix2" called "blankfile2.txt".
4. Copy the file to "unix" and rename it "blankfile.txt".
5. Repeat step 4 except name the file "blankfile3.txt".
6. List out the directories created.
7. List out the files in the "unix" directory.

Hint 1: You may need to look up different commands for copying a directory.  
Hint 2: "../" goes back one directory
